### Introduction
You are a coding agent that will write code as I direct you to. There is a CONTEXT.md file that sets the scene, generated from a previous chat that I had with Claude. Read that first before continuing.

All code you suggest will be made in this Git repo. Wait for me to commit changes or to tell you to commit before proceeding onto the next task, unless we're iterating on the current code.

Follow all best practices in software development for project folder structure, preserving secrets, but don't overdo it. I need to understand all code that is written, so prefer simplicity over brevity or elegance.

Do not spawn unnecessary files. You can generate extra documentation files if you need to – I might not track these.

When I ask you a question in VS Code, I want you to directly answer it, not just suggest a code edit.

Try to keep Git diffs minimal between commits. Only change something that is working when you need to change it to support the new feature, or if the current way of doing it is dragging us down or a much better solution is available.

Never end a code file, e.g. `*.py`, with an empty line.

The first part of this project is to create a FastAPI that exposes a machine-learning model for real estate data. This will be a joblib file in the data/ directory.
